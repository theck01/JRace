Create the SimpleUniverse with two arguments: The Canvas3D model and the
numTransforms. Set numTransforms to four, the first will be the translation and
the second will the be rotation for the car. The second two set the rotation and
translation for the camera offset from the car. Use the first two transforms with
the car to determine it's position.

MAKE SURE THAT CAR ANGLE AND DIRECTION VECTOR CORRESPOND TO DESIRED MOVEMENT WHEN
SETTING UP THE COURSE

Linear increase to early flatline for steering rate, after ~30mph the steering
ability of a car flatlines at some constant value

Step/Quadratic function models acceleration function

Linear function models braking, fairly rapid response

Timer ticks every 0.01s

Car is set to point along the positive Z axis with a direction value of 0
